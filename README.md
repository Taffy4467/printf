Write your own printf function.

Authorized functions and macros

write (man 2 write)
malloc (man 3 malloc)
free (man 3 free)
va_start (man 3 va_start)
va_end (man 3 va_end)
va_copy (man 3 va_copy)
va_arg (man 3 va_arg)

Compilation

$ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c

As a consequence, be careful not to push any c file containing a main function in the root directory of your project (you could have a test folder containing all your tests files including main functions)

Our main files will include your main header file (main.h): #include main.h

You might want to look at the gcc flag -Wno-format when testing with your _printf and the standard printf.
